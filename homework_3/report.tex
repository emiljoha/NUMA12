    %The document class defines the master templates, the structure of the document, 
    %and lays out the types of 
    %objects that can be manipulated for this type of document. 
    %the brackets contain basic options that will be applied globally (throughout
    %the document). Here, we specify a 10pt font, and when we number an equation, the 
    %number will be on the left.
    %The document class is a file ***.cls. You will probably never have to edit or create
    % a .cls file. There are many available on the internet for your use.

    %packages control the ``style'' or look of the document. These come in the form of 
    %files ***.sty. The package ``homework'' above was created by me. The other packages
    %are very common for this type of document. You can google to learn more about what
    %they can do, and what options they give you. For example

\usepackage{graphicx}
%\usepackage{svg}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage[margin=1.5in]{geometry}
    %the geometry package lets you customize the margins of your document.
    % and the 
  
\usepackage{setspace}
    %package gives us the ability to set the line spacing.
