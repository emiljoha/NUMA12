\begin{problem}
  Show that every $p in \mathcal{P}_n$ has a unique representation as
  $p = a_0 T_o + a_1 T_1 + \cdots + a_n T_n$. Find this representation
  in the case $p(x) = x^2$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cheby} T_n(\cos{\theta}) = \cos{n\theta}
  \end{equation} The Chebyshev polynomials as defined in
  equation~\ref{eq:cheby} are quite evidently linearly independent and
  elements in $\mathcal{P}_n$. The set $\{ T_0, \dots , T_n\}$ is
  therefor a set of $n+1$ linearly independent elements in a $n+1$
  dimensional vector space. Thus the Chebyshev polynomials form a basis
  of $\mathcal{P}_n$. The existence and uniqueness of the
  coefficient $a_0 \dots a_n$ follow from linear algebra.
  
  To actually find the coefficients is harder, as it often is in
  mathematics. We can however get an expression for the coefficients in
  quite a nice form by consider the scalar product defined in exercise 6
  in homework 2. In that exercise we also showed orthogonality. Both
  results are shown in equation~\ref{eq:homework2}.

  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:homework2}
    & \begin{cases}
      <f, g> = & \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{f(x) g(x)}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx \\
      <T_i, T_j> = & \delta_{i,j} ( \pi - \frac{\pi}{2}\delta_{i,o} )
    \end{cases} \\
    \nonumber
    \Rightarrow <p, T_i> =  & a_i ( \pi - \frac{\pi}{2}\delta_{i,o} ) 
                              \Leftrightarrow a_i =
                              \frac{<p,T_i>}{\frac{\pi}{2}\delta_{i,o}} \\
    \nonumber 
    <x^n, T_i>  = & \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{x^n T_i(x)}{sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx
    \\
    \label{eq:intexp} 
    a_i = & \frac{\int_0^\pi \cos^{n}\theta \sin{i\theta} d\theta}{\pi
            - \frac{\pi}{2}\delta_{i,o}} \\
  \end{align}

Equation~\ref{eq:intexp} gives an expression for the
coefficients. Attempts to evaluate this integral have been
unsuccessful.
