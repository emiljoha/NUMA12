\begin{problem}
  We showed in class that $B_n 1 = 1, B_n x = x $ and $B_n x^2 = ((n -
  1)x^2 - 1 ) /n$. Prove that the Bernstein approximation operator is
  not a projection.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  $X: \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ is a projection if and only
  if $X(a) = a \, \forall a \in \mathcal{A}$.

  It is evident that $B_n:C[0,1] \rightarrow \mathcal{P}_n$ for
  $n \geq 2$ are not a projections as
  $B_n x^2 \neq x^2 \in \mathcal{P}_n$ for $n \geq 2$. $B_0$ and $B_1$
  are however a projection as $\{1\}, \{1, x\}$ form a base for
  $\mathcal{P}_0$ and $\mathcal{P}_1$ respectively and they are
  linear operators.
\end{solution}
