\begin{problem}
Show the necessity of taking the \textbf{open} interval in condition (2) (page 77 of Powell's book) by considering the following case. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be spanned by $\Phi_0 = 1, \Phi_1(x) = \cos(2x), \phi_2(x) = \sin(3x), x \in [-\pi/6,\pi/2]$. Show that $\mathcal{A}$ is a Haar space of dimension 3, and that there is no function $p \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $p(-\pi/6) = 0$ but has no other zeros in the given range.
