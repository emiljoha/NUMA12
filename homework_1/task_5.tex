\begin{problem}
Show that the intersection of two convex sets is also convex
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two convex sets with a non-empty intersection. Take two points $x_1, x_2 \in S_1\cap S_2$. This means that the points are at the same time completely inside $S_1$ and $S_2$. Since $S_1$ and $S_2$ are both convex and the points are completely inside them, any two points in the intersection form a convex combination, therefore the intersection of two convex sets is also convex.
\end{solution}
