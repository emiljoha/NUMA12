\begin{problem}
Show that the intersection of two convex sets is also convex
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two convex sets with a non-empty intersection. Take any two points $x_1, x_2 \in S_1\cap S_2$. This implies that these two points are at the same time completely inside $S_1$ and $S_2$. As for instance $x_1,x_2 \in S_1$, by convexity of $S_1$, we have that $\lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda) x_2 \in S_1$ (We can do the same thing with $S_2$). Therefore the intersection of two convex sets is also convex.
\end{solution}
