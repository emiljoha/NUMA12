\begin{problem}
Find the best approximation from the space of polynomials of degree at
most one to $f(x) = x^2 , x \in [0 , 1]$ in:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\infty$-norm.
\item 2-norm.
\item 1-norm.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item [{\bf $\infty$-norm: }]
    $\frac{\partial (kx + m - x^2)}{\partial x} = 0$ gives a critical
    point 

  \item[{\bf 2-norm: }]
  We want to find the best approximation to the function $f(x) = x^2$ by a polynomial of degree at most one (i.e. of the form $p(x) = ax+b$). By definition the best approximation minimizes the norm of the difference, that is:
  \begin{equation*}
  \min \lVert x^2-ax-b \rVert_2
  \end{equation*}
  Let us define $g(x) = x^2-ax-b$. We want to find the parameters $a, b$ such that the integral is minimal (note that we take the norm squared):
  \begin{equation*}
  \int_0^1 g(x)^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{5} - \frac{a}{2} - \frac{2b}{3} - \frac{a^2}{3} + ab+b
  \end{equation*}
  Now we take the partial derivatives of this expression with respect to $a$ and $b$ and make them equal to zero, obtaining $a = -\frac{1}{3}, b = \frac{5}{18}$. Therefore the best approximation polynomial is $-\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{5}{18}$.
    
  \item [{\bf 1-norm: }]
We tried to take the same approach as for the two norm, that is, taking the integral:
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \lvert x^2-ax-b \rvert \, dx
\end{equation*}
But since we have an absolute value, we have to split the integral into parts. Assuming that the polynomial crosses the function twice (we determine this experimentally) we end up having to solve:
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \lvert x^2-ax-b \rvert \, dx = \int_0^{x_1} (-x^2+ax+b) \, dx + \int_{x_1}^{x_2} (x^2-ax-b) \, dx+ \int_{x_2}^1 (-x^2+ax+b) \, dx
\end{equation*}
Whereas it is possible to find expressions for $x_1$ and $x_2$, we find that the result of the integrals that we end up with is extremely hard to manipulate. Therefore we made a simulation in GeoGebra and the best possible polynomial we could find was $0.95x-0.15$ with $\lVert x^2-ax-b \rVert_1 = 0.06$

It is also interesting to note that as seen on the Figure, our guess for the 1-norm (red) is smaller than the $\infty$-norm's best approximation (blue).
