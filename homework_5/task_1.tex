\begin{problem}
  Write a program for the exchange algorithm. The program should take
  as input:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a continuous function f which is to be approximated
  \item the dimension n of the subspace A
  \item the interval $[a, b]$ in which f should be considered
  \item a reference (ordered set of $n + 1$ points in $[a, b]$)
  \item optionally a basis $\Phi_i \, , i = 1, \dots , n$ of the Haar
    space (i.e. a set of n functions).    
    If this input is not given your program should assume A = P n−1 and use the
    monomial basis instead.
  \item a tolerance tol.
  \item a number nsp of sample points (see below)
  \end{itemize}
  The program needs to evaluate the max-norm of the error. For this end, the error
  function has to be sampled at nsp equidistant points.
  The program should return
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the coefficients of the approximation to the best approximation
  \item an estimate of the error (distance to the best approximation in the max-norm)
  \item  the number of iterates
  \item  a vector with the reference level values h for every iteration
  \item  the actual reference
  \end{itemize}

  Test your program with the Runge function
  $f = \frac{1}{1 + 25x^2 } \, , [a, b] = [−1, 1]$ and $A = P_{n−1}$
    for various $v$.
