\begin{problem}
  Use a discrete version of the one-point exchange algorithm to
  calculate the best minimax approximation from the space of
  polynomials of degree at most one to the following seven function
  values: $f (0) = 0.3,\, f (1) = 4.2,\, f (2) = 0.1,\, f (3) = 3.4,\, f (4) =
  5.7,\, f (5) = 4.9,\, f (6) = 5.7$. Let the initial reference be the set
  of points $\{0, 3, 6\}$.
