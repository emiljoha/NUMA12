\begin{problem}
  In the exchange algorithm it is necessary to find the point $\eta$
  that satisfies the equation

  \begin{equation}
    |f (\eta) − p (\eta)| = \|f − p\|_{\infty}
  \end{equation}

  but in practice it is inefficient to try to calculate extrema of
  functions exactly.  Investigate useful ways to approximate $\eta$ and
  discuss your results.
