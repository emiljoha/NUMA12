\begin{problem}
  Show that $T_n$ and $T_{n-1}$ have no common zeros.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  First we assume there is an number $\theta$ such that $T_n$ and $T_{n-1}$ have common zeros.
  If there is such a $\theta$ then
  
  \begin{align*}
    \label{eq:CommonZero}
    \begin{cases}
      T_n(\cos\theta) = \cos n\theta = 0 \\
      T_{n-1}(\cos\theta) = \cos (n-1)\theta = 0
    \end{cases}
    \Leftrightarrow
    \begin{cases}
      n\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k \\
      (n-1)\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k^{\prime}
    \end{cases} \\
  \end{align*}

  Therefore $\theta = \pi(-k^{\prime} + k)$. If we insert this at $T_n$ we get:
  \begin{equation*}
  T_n(\cos \theta) = \cos(n\pi(-k^{\prime} + k))
  \end{equation*} which is $\pm 1$ depending on the parameters, but never zero,
  therefore, there is no $\theta$ that is the root of both $T_n$ and $T_{n-1}$
  at the same time. Note that not all $x$ can be written as
  $x = \cos \theta$ but only $x \in [-1, 1]$. However this is the
  interval in which Chebyshev polynomials are defined.
  \end{solution}
