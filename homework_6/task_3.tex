\begin{problem}
Find the best $L_1$ approximation to the function $f(x) = \sin(x) + \cos(x)$ in the interval $[\pi/3, 5\pi/3]$ from the space of polynomials of degree 2. Show that your result is indeed the unique best $L_1$ approximation to $f$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Blah blah blah

By the characterization theorem we see that our polynomial is indeed the best approximation:
\begin{equation*}
char theorem eq
\end{equation*}
and as we are approximating from the space of polynomials of degree at most two, which is a Haar space, we have by theorem (14.3 in Powell's book) that our best approximation is unique.
\end{solution}
