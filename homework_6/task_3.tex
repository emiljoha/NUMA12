\begin{problem}
Find the best $L_1$ approximation to the function $f(x) = \sin(x) + \cos(x)$ in the interval $[\pi/3, 5\pi/3]$ from the space of polynomials of degree 2. Show that your result is indeed the unique best $L_1$ approximation to $f$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
By theorem (14.5 in Powell's book) if the approximation space is the space of polynomials of degree at most $n$, if $e^*$ has exactly $n+1$ zeros, then they are the extrema of the Chebyshev polynomial $T_{n+2}$. Therefore, by changing the interval from $[\pi/3, 5\pi/3]$ to $[-1,1]$ and finding the extrema, we get that the zeros of the error function are:
\begin{equation*}
\xi_0 = \frac{\pi(3-\sqrt{2})}{3}, \quad \xi_1 = \pi, \quad \xi_2 = \frac{\pi(3+\sqrt{2})}{3}.
\end{equation*}
The polynomial we are trying to calculate has the form $ax^2+bx+c$, by interpolating at the values calculated above $(p^*(\xi_i) = f(\xi_i))$ and solving the linear system, we should get the best approximation:
\begin{align*}
a(\frac{\pi(3-\sqrt{2})}{3})^2+b(\frac{\pi(3-\sqrt{2})}{3})+c &= \sin(\frac{\pi(3-\sqrt{2})}{3}) + \cos(\frac{\pi(3-\sqrt{2})}{3}) \\
a \pi + b\pi +c &=-1 \\
a(\frac{\pi(3+\sqrt{2})}{3})^2 +b(\frac{\pi(3+\sqrt{2})}{3}) + c &= \sin(\frac{\pi(3+\sqrt{2})}{3}) + \cos(\frac{\pi(3+\sqrt{2})}{3})
\end{align*}
This gives us the values $a=0.4150, b = -3.2803, c = 5.2091$, thus the best approximation polynomial is:
\begin{equation*}
p^*(x)=0.4150x^2 -3.2803x+5.2091
\end{equation*}
By the characterization theorem, as the set $\mathcal{Z} = \{\xi_0, \xi_1, \xi_2 \}$ is composed of only discrete points, we have to show that:
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\pi/3}^{5\pi/3} s^*(x)p(x) \, \text{dx} = 0 \quad \forall p \in \mathcal{P}_2
\end{equation*}
where $s^*$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
cases
\end{align*}
It suffices to prove that for the monomial basis:
\begin{equation*}
proof
\end{equation*}
As for uniqueness, we are approximating from the space of polynomials of degree at most two, which is a Haar space, therefore by theorem (14.3 in Powell's book) our best approximation is unique.
